# Mission to Mars

Web scraping blew my mind! Suddenly, all the data on the internet was at my disposible. But I quickly learned about some hurdles which I'll go into below. This assignment was to use Beautiful Soup to scape the latest information on Mars, and use Python Flask to present the information on a webpage (refer to mission-to-mars.ipynb). We also had to learn the NoSQL database Mongo DB.

### Step 1 - Mars News

* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

### Step 2 - Featured Image

* Visit the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars). This image changes every 5-10 min. If a user were to refresh the end product (Flask App), the featured image is supposed to be updated based on what the featured image in real time.

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Find the image url to the full size `.jpg` image.

* Saved a complete url string for this image.

###  Step 3 - Mars Weather

* Visit the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scrape the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Save the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called `mars_weather`.


### Step 4 - Mars Facts

* Visit the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scrape the latest Mars weather tweet from the page.
* For this, I used pd.read_html (pandas html parser which detects html table tags).

### Step 5 - Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

* So when I was doing this assignment, The US had its government shutdown and one of the consequences was that NASA websites were not operational. So I found another website [here](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/bill-dunford/20140203-the-faces-of-mars.html) that I could scrape to acquire pictures of Mars' hemispheres.

## Step 6 - Load into MongoDB

* Use PyMongo to load information into MondoDB. I set it up, so that if a new scrape is performed, the latest information will overwrite the previous information on Mongo DB.

### Step 7 - Flask App (Optional)

Refer to folder. I created 2 routes:

* '/' : renders index.html template

* '/scrape' : renders latest scraped Mars data. This was my API layer. I set it up so that it jsonified all the scraped data from above. I removed the Mars News section because I did not want the user to have to launch a seperate chromedriver whenever the '/scrape' route was called to be able to get information. It would just slow things down.
